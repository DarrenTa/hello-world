# hello-world
First Repository for Darren Tapp

I'm a mathematition by training.  I maintain professional information about me at [darrentapp.com](https://www.darrentapp.com/).

Below is me testing out markdown with github.   I am testing if github will display this with MathJax.

$$I=\frac{V}{R}$$

I expect that that equation won't display correctly, and if so, I'll need to produce gifs of equations for github content using markdown.  If anyone reading this knows of a better way to display equations on github.  Please pull request or email me.

Enjoy the ride!
